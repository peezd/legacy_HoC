        Crimean history dates back to ancient times. The first inhabitants of 
        the peninsula lived here thousands of years ago and left a great number 
        of evidence proving their existence. Where scientists have uncovered the 
        dwellings of primitive man inside the many caves and grottos scattered 
        throughout the peninsula, some of them dating back to the Mustierian epoch 
        (10,000 to 40,000 years ago). In 1924 in Keek-Koba, a cave which is situated 
        25km away from Simferopol was discovered the first burial of a Neanderthal 
        man in the territory of the former Soviet Union. It was a female and not 
        far from this burial site there were found the remains of a one-year-old 
        child. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="A"></a>Ancient Crimea</strong> </p>
      <p>Around the 9th century BCE. The Tavrs are considered to be the first 
        inhabitants of Crimea, and it is from them that the original name of the 
        peninsula Tavrida comes. The well known Greek tragedy by Euripides, (Iphigenia 
        in Crimea) is based on the myth of a priestess of Diana in Tavrida, and 
        it takes place at cape Fiolent or on mount Ayu-Dag. <br>
        Herodotus, the father of history (5th century BCE) who visited the northern 
        areas of Crimea, says that they were a militant, mighty and cruel tribe. 
        According to Herodotus &quot;the Tavrs sacrifice those who suffered a 
        shipwreck and those ancient Greeks that they captured in the open sea 
        to the Virgin.&quot; The historian Polien in the 2nd century BCE said, 
        &quot;just before the battle, Tavrs would always damage the roads in the 
        rear to make them impassable so that they not being able to flee, had 
        to either win or die.&quot; <br>
        However, according to the archeological data the Tavrs of the later periods 
        appear to be more peaceful: they had become mountaineers and cattle-breeders, 
        and those who lived in valleys were engaged in agriculture, cattle breeding, 
        pottery and weaving. The Tavrs lived in semi-dugouts and huts made of 
        twigs covered with clay. <br>
        According to Herodotus, in the 6th to 5th centuries BCE. The Tavrs occupied 
        the whole coastal and mountainous parts of Crimea from Kerkinitida (Yevpatoria) 
        to Feodosia. The Tavrs, as an ethnic group disappeared in the 1st century 
        CE as they became integrated into other ethnic groups that have moved 
        into the area. <br>
        The Greek influence in Tavrida (Crimea) lasted from the 6th century BCE. 
        To the 4th century CE. Crimea has always been a crossroad of the world 
        where the lives and destinies of different nationalities have become interwoven. 
        A special interest for those who visit Crimea today are the ruins of Panticapaeum, 
        the capital of the Bospor state (Kerch), Chersonesus (Sevastopol), Kerkinitida 
        (Yevpatoria), and Neapol Skifsky (Simferopol) which became the capital 
        of a later Scythian state. <br>
        The first Greeks arrived in northern Crimea around the 7th century BCE. 
        Greek merchants arrived on military vessels filled with goods founded 
        several costal settlements which gradually developed into independent 
        city-states. However, they have always maintained close trade and cultural 
        ties with the Greek mainland. The first city of the kind was Panticapaeum, 
        founded in the sixth century BCE. on the eastern coast by Asian dwellers 
        of the Asia Minor city state of Milet. Around Panticapaeum on the Bospor 
        coast and Black Sea, New Greek settlements appeared such as Nymphei, Mirmekiy, 
        Tiritaka, Kimmeric Porfmiy and others. <br>
        On the Taman peninusla there were founded the cities of Fanagoria and 
        Germonassa. The remains of these cities can still be seen today. <br>
        Around the beginning of the fifth century BCE these various city-states 
        united into the Bospor Kingdom with Panticapaeum at its capital. Later 
        on, Feodosia would join this union. The population was heterogeneous: 
        apart from the Greeks lived the Scythians, Protoslavs, Meots, and others. 
        <br>
        In the second half of the 5th century BCE the inhabitants of other Greek 
        city-states on the Southern Coast of the Black Sea Gerakleya Pontiyskaya 
        (Eregli, Turkey) founded what is present day Sevastopol the city-state 
        of Chersonesus Tavrichesky to which Kerkinitida (Evpatoria) and Kalos-Limen 
        (Chernomorskoe) were subject to. <br>
        The ancient Greeks built ships, cathedrals, and theaters, they grew wheat, 
        barley, grapes, and had various handicrafts, winemaking, and fisheries. 
        During that time Bospor became the largest supplier of cereals to Greece. 
        <br>
        The Scythians in Crimea and their kingdom existed from the 3rd century 
        BCE to the 3rd century CE. Around the end of the 3rd century BCE the steppe 
        and foothills of Crimea was established a Late Scythian kingdom with Neapol 
        as its capital. This state appeared after numerous tribes of the Sarmat 
        who had come from the East and who eventually ousted the Scythians from 
        the steppes that stretched from the Dnieper to the Don rivers. Memory 
        of the Scythians, have usually regarded their military invincibility and 
        prowess that have been preserved for centuries in legends and historical 
        chronicles. In his &quot;history&quot; Herodotus, during the 5th century 
        BCE had visited present day Ukraine and devoted many pages to Scythia; 
        Strabon wrote about the Scythians as well. The Scythian state in Crimea 
        was very powerful and occupied vast territories on the peninsula. <br>
        The Scythians and the population of the Greek cities had close trade, 
        political and cultural ties. However, their relationships were not always 
        friendly and peaceful. The Scythians had conquered Kerkinitida and Kalos-Limen 
        in western Crimea and had attacked the city walls of Chersonesus more 
        than once. <br>
        For instance, at the end of the 2nd century BCE Chersonesusians had to 
        appeal for assistance to Mitridat, the governor of the Black Sea region, 
        and in 63 CE to a Roman Provincial governor. <br>
        The Scythian state lived in prosperity during the times of their emperor 
        Skilur and his son Palak (Second century BCE). The late Scythian state 
        finally perished in the middle of the 3rd century CE when a tribal union 
        of Goths had rushed into Crimea. The Scythians have abandoned many burial 
        chambers, some of which have contained great treasures in gold. <br>
        For example, the kurgan (burial mound) of the Scythian emperor Kul-Oba, 
        which is situated several kilometers to the north of Kerch, is the place 
        where a governor, his wife and a slave were buried. Within these burial 
        mounds treasures dating back to the 4th century BCE have been discovered. 
        They include masterpieces of ancient jewelry: famous vases made of Electra 
        (an alloy of gold and silver) with scenes of everyday Scythian life, a 
        golden spiral Hrivna with figures of Scythian horsemen, rich pendants 
        and the like. Today these treasures are stored in the Hermitage Museum 
        in St. Petersburg. <br>
        Sometime in and about 40 CE the southern part of the peninsula became 
        part of a Roman province. After the Romans had crushed the troops of the 
        Bospor Emperor Farnuk, the son of Mitridat, in the battle near Zele in 
        47 CE. It was this victory which Julius Caesar laconically reported to 
        Rome the famous words: &quot;Veni, vidi, vici&quot; (I came, I saw, I 
        conquered). <br>
        In 62 CE Chersonesus was under siege by the Scythians, which citizens 
        appealed to ships of a Roman Mezian squadron, which belonged to Plavtiy 
        Silvan, the governor of the Lower Mezia, the squadron was dispatched to 
        Cheronesus. After driving off the Scythians, the Romans occupied the city, 
        which later became a Roman stronghold. It was here where they stationed 
        the 5th Macedonian, 11th Clavdian and the 1st Italian legions as well 
        as a fleet of ships. The Romans built the fortress Kharax at cape Ay-Todor, 
        and fortifications in various other places. The Romans had built a road 
        from Chersonesus to Kharax through Shaitan-Merdven pass and the Baidar 
        valley. Roman rule of the peninsula lasted until the end of the 3rd century 
        CE when the legionaries were called back to Rome. <br>
        Starting in the third century, the northern region of the Black Sea and 
        the Crimean peninsula were overrun by nomadic tribes, which slowly eroded 
        the Greek and Scythian states who were not able to resist the invasion 
        of the Ostgoths as they were migrating to the south from the Baltic Sea. 
        Gothic domination did not last long. A century later, the northern region 
        of the Black Sea was swept by numerous hoards of Huns from Central Asia. 
        In 375 CE the Huns swept through the Crimean steppe, crushing the remaining 
        settlements of the Scythians and Sarmatians in their way. Only Chersonesus 
        survived, as it was not in the direct path of the rampage. <br>
        Medieval Crimea (5th - 17th centuries) <br>
        Throughout Crimean history, whenever invaders would appear in the peninsula 
        to devastated it, then they in turn would be either conquered by new, 
        more powerful invaders, or they would be assimilated with the native population. 
        As it was during the ancient period, it would remain the case during the 
        Middle Ages in Crimea. After the Huns' advance, other nomadic groups would 
        occupy the peninsula; however, none of them would leave anything noticeable. 
        <br>
        Crimea has an abundance of late medieval period Genoese and Turkish fortresses; 
        cave towns, medieval monasteries, Orthodox cathedrals and Muslim mosques, 
        as well as a Khan's palace. <br>
        For centuries, the southern and south-western part of the peninsula were 
        parts of the Byzantine order, created out of the division of the Roman 
        Empire into Eastern and Western parts. On the peninsula their main city 
        of Chersonesus was renamed &quot;Herson&quot;. The Byzantines tried to 
        strengthen their domination on the peninsula with the help of Christianity, 
        which had come here in the fourth century CE. <br>
        By the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth centuries, when 
        the iconostas movement was strong in Byzantium, several icon keepers appeared 
        in Crimea. Where they established monasteries in southwestern Crimea. 
        <br>
        In order to defend Chersonesus and its mountain surroundings from invasions, 
        Byzantium built defense structures, cave towns, and fortresses on mountain 
        passes. Alternatively, there are some who believe that local people built 
        these cities, monasteries, and castles. <br>
        Since the time of Rome, Crimea had been important to trade, military and 
        cultural connections for the Kiev Rus. When it was strengthened significantly 
        during this period with Byzantium. <br>
        In 944 CE agreements arose between Igor, prince of Kiev and Byzantine 
        over defense issues against the &quot;Black Bulgars&quot; who inhabited 
        the area around the Azov Sea. Later there was the cooperation with Herson 
        by the great Prince Vladimir or Kiev, which followed his marriage with 
        the Byzantine princess Anna, and his subsequent acceptance of Christianity. 
        These events are in fact still preserved at Chersonesus with St. Vladimir's 
        Cathedral and the monument to Vladimir the Great. In the tenth century 
        in the eastern part of the peninsula, the Tmyutarakan Princedom became 
        a part of the Kiev Rus Princedom. <br>
        After the weakening and eventual fall of the Byzantine Empire, only a 
        few princedoms remained intact in the Crimea. <br>
        At the beginning of the 13th century, a new wave of colonists appeared 
        on the southern coast of the peninsula; this time they were from the Italian 
        republics of Venice and Genoa. After the conquest of Constantinople in 
        1204 by crusaders, trade with the East began to be developed throughout 
        the Black Sea and the Crimean peninsula. The western end of the Silk routes, 
        which connected the Mediterranean countries with India and China, came 
        through Kafa (Feodosia), Soldiya (Sudak), and Tana (Azov) on the eastern 
        coast of Crimea. <br>
        To defend their trade vessels and cities on the coast from invaders, the 
        Italians built several fortresses along the southeastern coast of Crimea. 
        The Venetians established themselves at Sugday (Sudak), while the Genoese 
        built up positions at Kafa; gradually the Genoese displaced their competitors 
        and became masters of the entire southeastern coast from Kafa to Chambala 
        (Balaclava). <br>
        Kafa became one of the largest world trade centers at that time. Here, 
        representatives of the world's largest trading powers convened, often 
        for trafficking slaves for markets. <br>
        After the occupation of Constantinople in 1453 by the Turks, Kafa and 
        Sufdaya lost their significance as trade hubs. In the summer of 1475, 
        Turks occupied Kafa and the other Genoese possessions in the area. The 
        city's name was changed the Kefye, and it became a Crimean province of 
        the Turkish Sultan. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="B"></a>Bubonic Plague (1347-1351) </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        One of the most tragic events in European history was the Black Plague, 
        which is now historically accepted to have originated from the city of 
        Kafa (Feodosia). In 1347 the plague first arose among Mongol Tatar troops 
        who had laid siege to Kafa at the time. Their entire army was practically 
        wiped out, realizing they would be unable to capture the fortress, the 
        Tatars, using catapults hurled plague-infected bodies over the fortress 
        walls into the city. The epidemic quickly raged through Kafa and the Genoese 
        were forced to abandon their stronghold, escaping by ships. Wherever they 
        stopped on their way to Genoa, they passed the affliction to local populations. 
        The Bubonic Plague would go on to kill more than 24 million people, nearly 
        one quarter of the population of Europe at that time. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="C"></a>Crimean Khanate (1443-1783) </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        Mongol Tatars, coming from Asia, first appeared on the southern steppe 
        of modern day Russia during the first part of the 13th century. In 1223 
        they attacked the Crimean peninsula, not meeting any significant resistance, 
        their troops were able to envelop the entire peninsula. Further attacks 
        would follow in 1233, 1242 and 1349. These tribesmen would quarter in 
        Crimea for the winter, and in the spring, they would leave to the north 
        with livestock, cattle, and other supplies. During the 13th and 14th centuries, 
        Mongol Tatars established the Crimean Yuhrt, which was one of the three 
        parts of the Golden Horde. The administrative and trade center was the 
        city Salhat, whose name was changed to Krim, and later to Eski-Krim (Stary 
        Krim). <br>
        In the middle of the 15th century, as the Golden Horde was beginning to 
        weaken, the Crimean Yuhrt was transformed into a separate Khanate. Its 
        founder was Hadji-Girei, the first Crimean Khan, and a descendant of Genghis 
        Khan. The rulers of the Khanate would go on and rule Crimea for more than 
        some 300 years. However, upon independence from the Golden Horde, the 
        Ottoman Turks subsequently forced the Khanate into vassaldom in 1478. 
        From here on out, the Turkish sultans would appoint and dismiss Crimean 
        Khans at will and Crimea would be forced to provide troops for the Ottoman 
        army. <br>
        The southern, mountainous region also became a Turkish military administrative 
        area and was subsequently covered by Turkish fortresses. <br>
        The economy of the Khanate was very weak and subsisted solely upon occasional 
        raiding expeditions on its equally impoverished neighbors. The beginning 
        of widespread slavery, started during the reign of Mengli-Gerei, which 
        led to a stabilization of the Crimean economy, thus, Crimea became an 
        important international market for slaves. <br>
        Starting from the 17th century a serious barrier that impeded invasion 
        attempts from eastern Ukraine, Moscow and Polish lands, was the presence 
        of the Zaporojskiy Sech. The Zaporojskiy Cossacks not only effectively 
        halted the Crimean Khanate's expansion off of the peninsula, but also 
        threatened the administration itself, often carrying out raids and expeditions 
        into Crimea. <br>
        During a series of attacks in 1616 Cossack forces occupied Kefye, executed 
        14,000 Turkish troops, and set free more than 7,000 slaves. Even though 
        there was great antipathy between the Cossacks and the Khanate at the 
        time, they were still able to maintain trade relations, and on several 
        occasions even supported each other in military campaigns. <br>
        Conquest of Crimea <br>
        Striving to possess Crimea as a means to access the Black Sea, the Russian-Turkish 
        war lasted from 1768-1774, but following the peace with Turkey (1774), 
        Russian troops, like the Turks, withdrew from the peninsula to the northern 
        Azov coast. Along with the troops who were pulling out of the peninsula 
        were some 30,000 Greeks, Armenians, and other nationalities. Chaterine 
        the Great, who considered Tatars a nation not worthy on independence, 
        cut the independence of the Tatar Khanate short. On February 8, 1783 she 
        declared the annexation of Crimea into the Russian empire. Ever since 
        that date, the Crimean Khanate has ceased to exist. After Crimea was included 
        into the Russian empire, significant numbers of Crimean Tatars began to 
        immigrate to Turkey. Catherine the Great in turn redistributed the abandoned 
        land among Russian nobles. At this time, the Russian cities of Simferopol 
        and Sevastopol were funded. It was also around this time when the southern 
        coast of Crimea was being decorated with elegant castles, villas, and 
        residences full of gardens, parks, and wide-scale viticulture. Expert 
        architects and engineers were engaged in the construction of these projects 
        and palaces, which were ornately decorated with the help of famous artists 
        and sculptors. Today, these monuments and sites provide much allure for 
        tourists who visit this part of the Crimea. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="D"></a>The Crimean War (1854-1855) </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The Crimean peninsula was the main stage of one of the bloodiest wars 
        of the nineteenth century the Crimean War (1853-1856). War was started 
        due to the Turkish Sultan's refusal to heed the demands of Nicholas II. 
        Nicholas II demanded that the claims of the Orthodox clergy in Palestine 
        be restored and that the Russian Tsar be allowed to support Orthodox Christians 
        living in Turkey. The Turkish government refused, and as a result, Russian 
        troops invaded the Dunai provinces within the Ottoman Empire, on September 
        22, 1853 the Ottomans declared war on Russia. Great Britain, France, and 
        Sardinia who were interested in curtailing further Russian growth further 
        supported the Ottomans. <br>
        It would be Sevastopol that would lie at the center of this conflict. 
        By September of 1854 an army of 62,000 soldiers began to move towards 
        Sevastopol. The first battle of the war took place near the Alamar River 
        on September 8, 1854. It ended in significant losses for Russia, who were 
        both outnumbered and had inferior weapons compared to the collation forces. 
        The Russian troops were forced to retreat to Sevastopol and later to Bakhchisarai. 
        <br>
        French bases were mainly placed on the shore of Kamishovaya Bay, while 
        the British were stationed in Balaclava. On June 18,1855 the Allies attempted 
        to storm the bastions of Sevastopol, but the defenders of the city held 
        their ground. Franz Rubot has immortalized this Battle on the huge canvas 
        of the &quot;Panorama&quot;. The defenders of Sevastopol suffered great 
        losses that day and the city was practically leveled. <br>
        Much of the blame for losing this war was directed towards the Tsar and 
        the Russian Military High Command, who had placed their hopes more on 
        the heroism of their soldiers than the availability of gunpowder. The 
        Crimean High Command tried a last ditch effort to counter attack, following 
        Sevastopol, but they were soundly defeated at battles at Inkerman and 
        Chernorechensk. On the 27 September, Coalition forces began a new attack 
        capturing Malabov Kurgan, a key position for defending the region. <br>
        There were great losses suffered during to the desperate the battle for 
        Sevastopol. More that 128,500 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded 
        during the fighting. In March 1856 Russia was forced to sign a humiliating 
        surrender in Paris. Under the terms of that treaty, the Black Sea was 
        declared neutral territory and Russia lost all claim to possess a navy 
        on it. <br>

      <p><strong><a name="E"></a>Crimea during Russian Civil War (1918-1920) </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The years of the Russian Civil War were among one of the most tragic and 
        bloody periods of the peninsula's history. <br>
        On February of 1917 Crimea established a provisional Government, similar 
        to that in Russia when authority shifted from a Tsarist governor to a 
        representative Provisional government. It was during this period that 
        the formation of political parties truly began. <br>
        The rise of the Bolsheviks in St. Petersburg in October of 1917 began 
        in Crimea with the formation of the Congress of the 1st Regiment of the 
        Black Sea Fleet. The Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist 
        Party (RCP) respectively called for the creation of Bolshevik party activists 
        that would turn the peninsula into the &quot;Kronstadt of the south&quot;. 
        It was in Sevastopol where the formation of these revolutionary military 
        units first began. <br>
        On November 26, 1917 an assembly declared the formation of a National 
        Crimean Republic, where city and local government administrations were 
        established. From these bodies were selected the members of the Council 
        of Regional Deputies. Along with detachments from the Black Sea Sailors 
        and Red Guards from Sevastopol, Soviet forces were able to take control 
        of Crimea by January 1918. <br>
        By May of 1918, Allied forces occupied the peninsula and German control 
        would last until November of that year. Following their withdrawal, political 
        disagreements would be replaced with violence between red and white forces. 
        Control of the Crimean peninsula went back and forth, and with the momentary 
        ascendancy of one force, there would come a reign of terror: a Red Terror 
        would give way to a White, which in turn would lead to another Red. The 
        last massacres on the peninsula took place after the end of the Civil 
        War where tens of thousands of white officers, soldiers, and officials, 
        who were unable to evacuate in time, were executed. Even the Mahonetz, 
        who were allied with the Red Army during the storming of Perekopskiy Fortress, 
        were liquidated with ruthlessly. <br>
        Crimea had earned the nickname &quot;Graveyard of all Russia&quot;. The 
        chief architect of these massacres was the chairman of the Crimean Revolution 
        committee, Bela Kun and the Secretary of the Oblast Committee of the Russian 
        Communist Party, R. Zemlyachko (Samoylov). <br>
        During the years of the Civil War, control over the peninsula raged back 
        and forth for many times, First it was known as the Tavricheskiy Republic, 
        then the Soviet Socialist Republic of Tavrida, then the Regional Administration 
        of General S Soo'kevich, the Solomon-Crimean Grovernmnet, the Soviet Crimean 
        Republic, the Administration of General Denikin, theAuthoritative region 
        of General Vrangel, the Crimean Revolutionary… and the list goes on. <br>
        In May of 1921, it was decided by a general meeting of the Central Communist 
        Party of Russia to finally establish the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist 
        Republic (CASSR). The entity would last for more than 20 years until the 
        June of 1945, when the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation would 
        reorganize Crimea into the Crimean Oblast. <br>
        Crimea During WWII <br>
        From 1941 until 1944, the Eastern Front moved back and forth across the 
        Crimean peninsula. The Nazis first struck the Soviet Union at Sevastopol, 
        a highly strategic port harboring the Black Sea Fleet. On June 22, 1941 
        heavy bombardment on the city began and the entrance of Sevastopol Harbor 
        was heavily mined, designed to force the Soviet ships confined to port 
        for the duration of the war. <br>
        The Nazi seizure of Crimea had special importance for Hitler and his generals, 
        because together with other provinces in Ukraine, they would be incorporated 
        as part of the eastern empire, permitting the Lebensraum expansion for 
        the German people. Over the course of the war, Crimea would become significant 
        due to its strategic location. <br>
        At the start of the war, in northern Crimea, poorly equipped Red Army 
        units held on outnumbered by Nazi forces. Noteworthy battles in Crimea 
        that still live on and were a source for pride during the Soviet era such 
        as; the 250 day fight for Sevastopol (October 20, 1941 - July 1942), as 
        well as stories of courage and endurance which took place at the Adjmoushkaya 
        garrison near Kerch, along with numerous daring marine landings, and the 
        raids that took place by members of the Crimean underground. <br>
        Crimea came under Soviet control in the spring of 1944, after Soviet forces 
        established a beachhead on the eastern coast of the peninsula and then 
        swept westward. The 4th Ukrainian Army together with separate marine units 
        crushed the 17th German Army, retaking Crimea. On May 9, 1944 Sevastopol 
        was under Soviet control when the Red Army swept onto the Gerakleya peninsula 
        and captured the last of the Nazi troops in the territory. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="F"></a>The Deportation </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        On May 11, 1944 as the final skirmishes with Nazi troops were taking place 
        near Sevastopol, Joseph Stalin signed Soviet State Committee Order 5859 
        &quot;Concerning Crimean Tatars&quot;. This document ordered their immediate 
        expulsion from Crimea. NKVD security forces began on the evening of May 
        18, 1944, and by May 20, 1944 the order was completely fulfilled. The 
        thoroughness of this operation was in due in part to their familiarity 
        and experience with such tasks; as less that some ten years previously, 
        the same measures had been employed against resisting peasants in Ukraine, 
        Kuban and various other regions. These people were ultimately sent to 
        Siberia. <br>
        June 2, 1944, the State Crimean Oblast Authority called for &quot;the 
        immediate evacuation from Crimea of 37,000 German collaborators of Bulgarian, 
        Greek, or Armenian origin&quot;. These &quot;Fascist collaborators&quot; 
        turned out to be all the Germans, Bulgarians, Greeks, and Armenians who 
        lived on the peninsula. On the night of June 15 they too suffered the 
        fate of the Crimean Tatars. <br>
        According to the best information available, in &quot;History Issues&quot; 
        an academic journal estimates that 191,000 Crimean Tatars, 15,000 Greeks, 
        12,400 Bulgarians, and 9,600 Armenians were deported to Eastern regions 
        in 1944. More than 50,000 Germans had already been moved by force to the 
        Far East after the outbreak of war in August of 1941. <br>
        Yalta Conference <br>
        In February 1945 three months before the end of the war with Nazi Germany, 
        a conference took place with three Ally leaders at Livadia in Crimea. 
        Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were the participants. 
        <br>
        The conference took place on February 4-11, in the Great White Hall of 
        Livadia Palace. During the conference, agreements on coordinating actions 
        after the war, and the spheres of influence that would mark the post war 
        world were made. It was here where the &quot;Big Three&quot; agreed on 
        establishing the United Nations and some other of the mechanisms to come, 
        governing the future world order. <br>
        During the conference, Roosevelt and the American delegation resided at 
        Livadia Palace itself. Churchill and the British delegation stayed at 
        the Vorontsov Palace in Alupka, while Joseph Stalin and the Soviet delegation 
        stayed at eh Yusopovskiy Palace in Koreyz. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="G"></a>Crimea and Ukraine </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        Up until the revolution and the formation of the Soviet system in Crimea, 
        a governor under the control of the Tsar governed the peninsula as a province. 
        <br>
        In 1921 following the order of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist 
        Party, the Crimean Peninsula was set up as a separate Autonomous Republic 
        within the Soviet Federation. In June 1945 after the deportation of Crimean 
        Tatars, Greeks Armenians, and Bulgars, the Supreme Soviet in Moscow ended 
        the autonomous status of Crimea and changed it to an oblast status within 
        the Soviet Union. In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was transferred to the control 
        of Ukraine. <br>
        This transfer was precipitated by the extremely difficult conditions in 
        the agricultural sector at the time following the war. To deal with the 
        great human and material loss that the war had inflicted upon Crimea, 
        there was a shortage in labor as well. This problem was particularly critical 
        in the country and in mountainous regions of Crimea. With no one to maintain 
        the land, orchards and vineyards fell into disrepair. <br>
        Even massive migrations of workers from Ukraine and Russia did little 
        good initially, as many of these agricultural workers were from more northern 
        territories and were not used to working in the hot dry conditions of 
        Crimea. Many of them returned home, by 1953 on the eve of the transfer 
        of administrative control to Ukraine, basic agricultural production for 
        the peninsula still stood at 1.5 to 2 times less than it had before the 
        war in 1941. Many collective farms and vineyards had been abandoned and 
        dairy supplies from farms were extremely low. Similarly, other indicators 
        of the domestic economy were equally poor. Even though some ten years 
        had passed since after the war, only 154 resorts were in operation (far 
        fewer than pre-war numbers), compounded with pervasive shortages of electricity, 
        fuel, and water. Crimea was not able to provide these needed services, 
        relying entirely on regular subsidies from Russia. <br>
        This economic problem served as the basis for the Russian transfer of 
        control of Crimea over to the Ukrainian SSR for administrative control. 
        On December 3, 1954 in a joint session of the Presidium of the Central 
        Committee of the Communist Party and the Supreme Soviet, legislative wrangling 
        came to an end and in accordance with article 78 of the constitution, 
        transfer was made for consideration of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian 
        Soviet Socialist Republic. <br>
        Given the extreme economic situation of that time shifting administration 
        to the much closer Ukraine made economic sense. The later suggestions, 
        that Crimea &quot;was given as a present to Ukraine&quot; is a fantasy 
        . <br>
        After the adoption of the decree in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 
        the 5th of February and then in the Presidium of the Ukrainian SSR on 
        February 13, 1954 final approval made for this change. On April 26, 1954 
        at the 5th session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, control was formally 
        handed over to Ukraine. <br>
        Crimean Development <br>
        In the following years, the domestic economy of Crimea had improved greatly. 
        By 1974 there were more than 170 new and fully equipped manufacturing 
        sites, an enormous GRES power station, an airport, a trolley bus terminal, 
        and a bus terminal had been put into operation. For the years 1956-1960, 
        the area of cultivated orchards and vineyards grew five times than at 
        any other similar period in 70 years. In 1961, the construction of the 
        North Crimea Canal began, and two years later, water from the Dnieper 
        River began to flow into the peninsula. The previously unpopulated steppes 
        of Crimea are now thriving villages and farms. <br>
        Unfortunately, over the past ten years, this progress has not continued. 
        Economic difficulties associated with the transition to a free market 
        system and related problems in the social sphere have beset Crimea on 
        all sides. Still, this sad story is not unique to this part of Ukraine 
        or the former Soviet Union. Many of the problems cannot be solely solved 
        within the peninsula, being regional in nature, but still Crimeans endure 
        and look to the future with the hope of better things to come. <br>
        On June 12, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation made the 
        declaration for its own sovereignty. Following this, the Ukrainian Soviet 
        Socialist Republic and now former republics of the USSR announced their 
        sovereignty as well. This resulted in the ultimate break up of the Soviet 
        Union. <br>
        On August 24, 1991 the official independence of Ukraine was announced, 
        this act being later supported by Ukrainian referendum on December 1. 
        In this vote, nearly all citizens took part and along with their countrymen, 
        even Crimeans voted in favor of the creation of the new Ukrainian state. 
        <br>
        In January following the referendum, a further plebiscite was held, this 
        time only in Crimea, to address the question of the autonomous status 
        of the peninsula. Resulting from this referendum, the Supreme Soviet of 
        Ukraine passed a bill that restored autonomous status to Crimea. <br>
        On May 6, 1992 the Crimean Legislative Council adopted a constitution 
        for an autonomous Crimea. This document, contradicted both the general 
        Constitution of Ukraine and the Kiev government's law &quot;Concerning 
        the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Ukraine&quot; (Which is still 
        and administrative unit of that country). The Crimean constitution was 
        later brought into sync with the Ukrainian Constitution, and today the 
        Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, adopted on October 
        21, 1998 is now in force. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="H"></a>The Return </strong><br>
        The Crimean Tatars and other ethnic groups who had been deported from 
        Crimea during the war were only &quot;politically and legislatively&quot; 
        rehabilitated some quarter century after the events of 1944. On September 
        5, 1967 the Supreme Soviet passed a decree &quot;On the rehabilitation 
        of persons of Tatar ethnicity who previously inhabited Crimea&quot;. However, 
        concrete effects of this decree would still not be felt for several more 
        years. It was not until 1989 when the Supreme Soviet denounced the original 
        act that had served as the basis for the deportation. It was at this point 
        then that Crimean Tatars and the other ethnic groups formerly living in 
        Crimea received permission to return to their native homeland. Their current 
        return and resettlement over the past ten years has been taking place 
        alongside difficult economic and social upheavals associated with the 
        transition from Soviet rule. <br>
        In June 1991, following a 74 year long absence, a Crimean National Council 
        was re-established, declaring the right for self-determination of the 
        Crimean Tatar people, and electing the Medijls, the highest authoritative 
        body representing the Crimean Tatar people. For the Crimean Tatar People 
        the 18th of May is known as the &quot;Day of Sorrow&quot;. Recently observing 
        the 55th anniversary of the Deportation in Simferopol, huge crowds of 
        Crimean Tatars met from all over Crimea. On the night before, peaceful 
        demonstrations took place where Crimean Tatar leaders erected a memorial 
        to the famous human rights advocate, General Petro Gregorevich Gregerenko, 
        who in the 1960s fought for the rights of the many suffering national 
        groups in the Soviet Union. He is also remembered as the first to bring 
        the cause of the Crimean Tatars to the international attention.<br>
