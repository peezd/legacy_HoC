      <p><font size="+1">Crimea, one of the jewels of the Black Sea has been saturated 
        by history and the migrations of nations. It was once the site of several 
        Ancient Greek colonies where they produced wines and traded with the local 
        Scythians whom inhabited the steeps region. It was the western capital 
        of the Mongol empire under Gensis Khan for many years. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Along Crimea’s eastern coast it is still littered with 
        Genosian fortresses as it was the western end of the silk road before 
        the precious treasures were loaded on ship and sent to Florence and Genosia 
        for sale in Europe. Overrun by the Ottoman Turks after the conquest of 
        Constantinople has influenced many of the indigenous Crimean cultures 
        a distinct Islamic and Middle Eastern flavor, which only adds to Crimea’s 
        mystique and exoticness. Later absorbed by the Russian Empire it was also 
        the scene of the famous “Charge of the Light Brigade” by Alfred Lloyd 
        Tennyson in the little town of Balaclava, during the Crimean War. The 
        period of Soviet domination and World War II when the whole peninsula 
        was under Nazi control, then followed by the subsequent “Big Three” meeting 
        near Yalta, has not only made a distinct mark on the people and the political 
        landscape of the world, but ensured Crimea’s place in modern history.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> We hope that this web site will share with you the rich 
        history, diverse cultures, sites, and beauty of this little peninsula 
        that we call home.</font></p>
