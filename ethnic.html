      <p><a name="A"></a><strong>Crimean Tatars </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The Crimean Tatars are an ethnic group that emerged from Crimea due to 
        the immense mixing of different groups throughout the peninsula's history. 
        The Crimean Taters are divided into three different groups. <br>
        The religion of the Crimean Tatars is Islam, and their priests are known 
        as Mufti. Their house of worship is called a Disclaim (Mosque). This mosque 
        is dome shaped and has minarets. The largest and most beautiful of them 
        in Crimea is Djuma-Djami in Yevpatoria. It was built in 1552 by the famous 
        Turkish architect Hodscha Mimad Sinan. <br>
        Even today Chebureki (sweet dough with a filling of mutton and spices, 
        fried in animal oils) are quite popular around the peninsula (especially 
        in the south). As well as shaslik, kebab and shurpa (mutton soup) are 
        still very popular. The most popular drink is busa (a soft alcoholic drink 
        from cherries). <br>
        The first Crimean Tatars belonged to the Crimean Yurt of the Golden Horde. 
        In 1443 the Crimean Khanate was founded with its own citizens. Following 
        the annexation of Crimea by Russia, a lot of Crimean Tatars escaped to 
        Turkey during 1860-1862 181,117 Tatars departed Crimea. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><a name="B"></a>Karaites</strong> <br>
      </p>
      <p>These people are one of the most peculiar ethnic groups on the planet. 
        Their number have been shrinking rapidly and there are only 2,000 known 
        surviving members, the majority of them live in Ukraine. Presently there 
        are only around 820 members of this group resideing in Crimea. The Karaites 
        much like the Krimchaks and the Crimean Tatars, are considered to be just 
        some of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. The largest populations of 
        karaites in Crimea are found in Simferopol, Yevpatoria, Yalta, bakhchisarai 
        and Feodosia. Yevpatoria is the center of spiritual life of the Karaites 
        where the great Kenassa temple can be found. These people are the descendants 
        of the original Turkish tribes which duringt the eighth through the tenth 
        crnturies belonged to the Kazar khanate. The language of the Karaites 
        belong to the Kipshakzer sub group of Turkic languages, and is related 
        to Crimean Tatar. <br>
        In terms of religion the Karaites use the old testament as the basis of 
        their faith. Their clergy are called Gachan, though priests are callen 
        Gassanen. <br>
        Since time immorial, Karaite Piroshkiys have been famous on the peninsula. 
        As well as a snack called Akalva (a type of Walnut marzipan) is well known 
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="C"></a>Krimchaks</strong> <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Krimchaks, much like the Karaites, are one of the original peoples 
        of Crimea. <br>
        Their language is a Turkic varient which is closely related to modern 
        Turkish, Crimean Tatar, and the Karaite language. Before the Second World 
        War there were about 8,000 members of this ethnic group. During the occupation, 
        many were terminated, so by 1959 there were only reported to be around 
        2,000 members of this ethnic group. Nowadays their numbers are again waning 
        due to assimilation. According to the last national census only 604 Krimchaks 
        currently lived in Crimea. Nonetheless, these people are the custodians 
        of their culture, carefully and steadfastly defending their customs and 
        traditions. Not long ago, a community center was formed and now there 
        is a museum, library and a Sunday school among the other facilities that 
        it provides. <br>
        Since the thirteenth century the Armenians, Bulgarians, and the Crimean 
        Greeks. The descendants of the ancient Greeks from the 6th century who 
        have been living on the peninsula. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="D"></a>Russians </strong><br>
      </p>
      <p>The largest part of the population are the ethnic russians, who came 
        to Crimea following the annexation to Russia. Indeed, the first settlers 
        were decommissioned Russian army officers, though soon after that came 
        the peasants and freemen from old manors and estates to this new land. 
        During the middle of the nineteenth century there were more than 15000 
        Russians in Crimea. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="E"></a>Ukrainians </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The descendants of present day Ukrainians from Kiev Rus had since time 
        immemorial have had contact in Crimea. In 944 it was Knyaz Igor of Byzantium 
        that began the conversion for Ukrainians. The document signed by Igor 
        of Kiev &quot;the land of the Korsunsk&quot; would be defended against 
        the &quot;black&quot; Bulgarians. In 965 the Tmutarakan Duchy was founded 
        on the coast of the Kerch peninsula, and including much of what is present 
        day Kerch. Since the ninth century the Black Sea has variously been called 
        the &quot;Russian Sea&quot;. This relationship grew weaker during the 
        time of the Crimean Khanate, though since the annexation of Crimea many 
        Ukrainians and Russinas have come to settle the peninsula. </p>
