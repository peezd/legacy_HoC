      <p>Crimea is the southern peninsula of Ukraine, the largest country solely 
        in Europe, and north across the Black Sea from Turkey. The Autonomous 
        Republic of Crimea (ARC) is an integral part of Ukraine today. The main 
        offices of political authority including the Representative of the President 
        of Ukraine in the ARC, The court of the ARC, The Supreme Soviet of the 
        ARC, The Council of Ministers of the ARC, as well as local representative 
        and state Supreme bodies of power. <br>
        The Autonomous Republic is divided into 14 regions, there are 18 cities 
        in Crimea, two of which (Sevastopol and Kerch) have been named &quot;Hero 
        Cities&quot; for their prominence during WWII. <br>
        Sevastopol however, is a separate administrative unit which is accountable 
        directly to Kiev and Moscow. <br>
        The population of Crimea is more than 2.5 million, and among them there 
        are representatives of more than 80 nationalities and ethnic groups. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The major <a href="ethnic.html"><strong>ethnic groups</strong></a><strong> 
        </strong>in Crimea are the Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars. The 
        smallest of the groups being the Krimchaks and Karaites. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The environment of Crimea is rich and diverse, it is surrounded on all 
        sides by the Black and Azov Seas. It is connected to the Ukrainian mainland 
        only by the narrow Perekopskiy Isthmus in the north of the peninsula. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The area is roughly 27,000 sq. km (approximately the size of Belgium). 
        From North to south, Crimea streaches some 205 km, while from east to 
        west the peninsula stretches for at least 325 km. Nonetheless in such 
        a modestly sized area as Crimea, the range of temperatures, climate, terrain, 
        and vegetation, is very diverse. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Anyone who ever travels the length of the peninsula will notice the drastic 
        changes in the landscape: the steeps, taking up about two thirds of the 
        peninsula, will give way to foothills, mountains, and finally cliffs that 
        fall into the crashing waves on the Southern Coast <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Crimean Mountains are a chain of peaks that stretch along the coast 
        from Sevastopol to Feodosia, extending some 180 km in what is one of the 
        true highlights of the Crimean coastline. These peaks are covered with 
        pines and beechforests. Though, upon the rolling plateaus do not have 
        much vigetation. This region is known as the &quot;yahla&quot;, that can 
        be translated as &quot;summer pasture&quot;. In springtime these yhlas 
        are covered with herbs and flowers, The Crimean Mountains protect the 
        Southern Coast from the brunt of cold northern winds, and thus provide 
        for unique natural conditions which gives rise to one of the best climates 
        for vacationing. </p>
